# TriviaGame

This is a brief trivia game built using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

In this project, I tried to utilize to a greater degree than I have in the past the functionality of objects. To this end, I included, for example, a key/value pair regarding which answer was the correct answer. I did this as an afterthought, in order to enable telling the user after each answer whether the answer was correct or not, but it could easily be used to, perhaps, simplify, and definitely in order to streamline the end score process. As it is, there are sort of two methods used to keep score, one for each individual question and answer, and the other for the game as a whole.

The theme was Monty Python inspired :-D
